/**
 * SupportCalculator - Strategy Pattern interface for probabilistic support computation.
 *
 * In uncertain databases, support is not a simple count but a PROBABILISTIC measure:
 *   - Each item has existence probability p in each transaction
 *   - Support follows a probability distribution, not a single value
 *   - Probabilistic support = max{s : P(support ≥ s) ≥ τ}
 *
 * Strategy Pattern allows different algorithms:
 *   - GFSupportCalculator: Dynamic Programming O(n²)
 *   - FFTSupportCalculator: Fast Fourier Transform O(n log² n)
 *   - HybridSupportCalculator: Auto-selects based on input size
 *
 * Mathematical Background:
 *   For itemset X in uncertain database:
 *   - Each transaction t has probability p_t that X appears
 *   - Total support S = Σ(indicator variables), where each is Bernoulli(p_t)
 *   - P(S = s) follows Poisson Binomial distribution
 *   - Generating Function: Π(1-p_t + p_t·x) encodes this distribution
